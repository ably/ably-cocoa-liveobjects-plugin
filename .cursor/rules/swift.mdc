When writing Swift:

- Be sure to satisfy SwiftLint's `explicit_acl` rule ("All declarations should specify Access Control Level keywords explicitly).
    - When writing an `extension` of a type, favour placing the access level on the declaration of the extension rather than each of its individual members.
    - This does not apply when writing test code.
